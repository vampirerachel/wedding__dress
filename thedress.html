<h2>The Dress</h2>
<p>Dress Description from the Rue de Seine website</p>
<p>"Off-white embroidery on mesh, paired with a deep sienna mesh lining, give the Jackson Gown a very modern romance.
    Ethereal and elegant, the form fitted silhouette to low hip and plunging neckline fuse effortless modern romance
    with
    classic beauty. Side godets add volume to the skirt, while maintaining a close to the body fit at the front. Floral
    lace
    is showcased beautifully with the contrast of sienna lining throughout the entire gown."</p>
